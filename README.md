# Customer Churn Analysis PowerBI

## Problem Statement
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.

## Key Points from the Data for Churn

- Customers at Risk: There are 1,869 customers identified as at risk. This is a critical metric that needs to be monitored closely.
- Tech and Admin Tickets: There are 2,173 tech tickets and 885 admin tickets. High numbers of tickets could indicate customer dissatisfaction, which is a potential churn indicator.
- Gender distribution is almost equal (49.8% female).
- 5% are senior citizens, 36% have partners, and 17% have dependents. These segments may have specific needs and retention strategies.
- The distribution of subscription times shows a significant portion of customers have been with the company for less than a year. Newer customers might be more prone to churn.
- 16% use electronic checks, 14% mailed checks, 12% bank transfers, and the rest credit cards. Payment issues can be a churn factor.
- 74.91% use paperless billing. This could be a factor in customer satisfaction and retention.
- 9% are on month-to-month contracts, which are more flexible and might indicate higher churn risk.
- 3% are on two-year contracts, which are more stable.
- 91% have phone service, 44% have streaming TV and movies. Lower percentages for services like online security (16%) and tech support (17%) might indicate areas for improvement.

## Key Insights from the Data for Customer Risk Analysis
The provided PDF contains several data points that can help in understanding customer retention and churn. Here are some key insights:

- The overall churn rate is 26.54%, meaning that 26.54% of customers have terminated their contracts.
- Out of 7043 total customers, 1869 have churned.
- The yearly charges for customers vary, and this could be a factor in churn. Customers with higher charges might be more likely to churn if they feel they are not getting value for their money.
- The number of tech tickets (2955) and admin tickets (3632) could indicate customer dissatisfaction. High numbers of tickets might correlate with higher churn rates.
- Customers with Fiber optic internet service might have different churn rates compared to those with DSL or no internet service. This data could help identify which service types are more prone to churn.
- The length of time a customer has been subscribed (ranging from 0 to 72 months) could be a factor in churn. Newer customers might be more likely to churn if they are not satisfied early on.
- Customers on month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate (40%) compared to those on one-year (20%) or two-year (0%) contracts. This suggests that long-term contracts might help in retaining customers.
- The payment method (e.g., bank transfer, credit card, electronic check, mailed check) could also influence churn.
